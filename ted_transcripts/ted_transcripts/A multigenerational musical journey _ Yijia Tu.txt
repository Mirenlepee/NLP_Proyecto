Can you imagine playing an instrument that has 2,000 years of history behind it? Would you honor the tradition by playing music of old, or look to add to its history with new music? Maybe both? This question is one that Chinese zither player, multi-instrumentalist, and composer Yi Jia Tu often asks. In this beautiful talk and performance, she shares what led her to this incredible instrument, and how for her, blending traditional and modern music bridges past and present, and the differences among us. So this is a gu zhen, an ancient Chinese zither that has over 2,000 years of history. But growing up in China, I played the two most popular instruments. Can you guess what they are? It's the guitar and the piano. Yeah. Not this. So I wrote a song on the guitar that ended up on one of the biggest music shows of the time, called Zhongguo Hao Gecu. And at 16, my life changed overnight. I entered this parallel universe as the Hannah Montana version of myself as a high school kid. I saw my face on news headlines. I heard my music played in public, which was a weird experience. And I was working with music legends I grew up admiring who helped my debut album, won the prestigious Huayu Bang Zhongbang, also known as the Chinese Music Awards. However, as a Chinese musician, my music was very westernized. I didn't sound Chinese, and in a way, I'm not sure if I really wanted to. You see, with traditional music, I didn't really think it was cool. I have to admit, in my language, there's this word for something that's not cool or backwards called Tu. But Tu literally means the earth or soil that we stand on. On the other hand, you have this word called Yangqi, which means the opposite, something very trendy and cool and avant-garde. But Yangqi literally means western. And over time, I realized that this isn't just a Chinese issue, but a global one. Music traditions are dying in the hands of our generation. But how can we preserve a tradition if we don't feel a personal connection to it? So I felt inspired to learn the traditional instruments and folk music to reconnect with my roots. But instead of playing traditional music, traditionally, it's important for me to be creative with it. So I'm going to show you how I do that. I'm going to play you a song that's a combination of a traditional folk song, as well as my own composition. I think you can guess which part is the traditional and which one is not. I think you can guess. I think you can think. I think you can guess. It's like a long that doesn't look too long. I think you can guess. And over time, I think the same thing. But I think that is blonde and a wanting that might be a strong kind of greeting. Thank you. Hey, is anyone home? I've been gone for too long I've just gone to spread all All that we are now found I've been gone for too long I've been gone for too long I've been gone for too long I've been gone for too long I've been gone for too long I've been gone for too long I've been gone for too long I've been gone for too long I've been gone for too long Thank you. Thank you. So there's this quote attributed to the composer Gustav Machler that I really like Tradition is not the worship of ashes but the preservation of fire and music can transcend not just the barriers of language and culture but also time and space For me, music can build a bridge between the East and the West the past and the present and between you and me and I've been gone for too long and I've witnessed how music can reach beyond the limits of not just our human memory but even our very own consciousness When my grandmother developed Alzheimer's we could no longer communicate through words However, there was this lullaby that she used to sing to me when I was a child It's a lullaby that her mother used to sing to her so it's been passed down in my family for over four generations and whenever I sing the melody she will recognize the melody and sing along with me which is really sweet and even though my grandmother has recently passed away whenever I sing this lullaby I still feel deeply connected with her It's almost like she's still singing along with me perhaps somewhere in a space that only exists through music The song I have been cast neighbour 詞曲 李宗盛 詞曲 李宗盛 詞曲 李宗盛 搖一搖 我的小寶寶 寶貝要睡覺 搖搖我的寶貝睡覺 睡著了 熬睡醒了 醒來 吃管糕 搖搖我的寶貝睡覺 搖搖我的寶貝睡覺 黑條 哖�一搖 坐哪 protection 甚麼 sexual ян makes 笑的更好 通風 鬱特 day My water doesn't study preparation Everybody That was Eja Tu speaking at TED 2025.
