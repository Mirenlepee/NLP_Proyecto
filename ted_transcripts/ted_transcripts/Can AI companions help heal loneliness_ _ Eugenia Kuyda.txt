 Hey there. If you've ever felt your confidence slip at work, you're not alone. The good news, confidence isn't a fixed trait. It's a skill. And like any skill, you can build it with the right tools and practice. I'm Anne Morris, CEO and bestselling author. And together with my wife, Frances Fry, a professor at Harvard Business School, we host the TED podcast Fixable. This season, we're zeroing in on confidence, what it really is, how to strengthen it, and how to help others see you as the leader you already are. So if you're ready to show up with more conviction, to get promoted, to lead with clarity, to do the best work of your career, join us on Fixable wherever you get your podcasts. You're listening to TED Talks Daily, where we bring you new ideas to spark your curiosity every day. I'm your host, Elise Hu. So many of us, after we lose a loved one, wish we could have one conversation with them again. And these days, AI replicas are making it possible to simulate chatting with someone who's gone by training AI tools with the loved one's data. In her 2024 talk, AI entrepreneur Eugenia Quida unpacks the benefits and the real potential dangers that come with AI companions and asks questions about how to design them in a smart way going forward. This is me and my best friend, Roman. We met in our early 20s back in Moscow. I was a journalist back then, and I was interviewing him for an article on the emerging club scene because he was throwing the best parties in the city. He was the coolest person I knew, but he was also funny and kind of a good friend. And always made me feel like family. In 2015, we moved to San Francisco and rented an apartment together. Both startup founders, both single, trying to figure out our lives, our companies, this new city together. I didn't have anyone closer. Nine years ago, one month after this photo was taken, he was hit by a car and died. I didn't have someone so close to me die before. It hit me really hard. Every night I would go back to our old apartment and just get on my phone and read and reread our old text messages. I miss him so much. By that time, I was already working on conversational AI, developing some of the first dialect models using deep learning. So one day, I took all of his text messages and trained an AI version of Roman so I could talk to him again. For a few weeks, I would text him throughout the day, exchanging little jokes just like we're always used to, telling him what was going on, telling him how much I missed him. It felt strange at times, but it was also very healing. Working on Roman's AI and being able to talk to him again helped me grieve. It helped me get over one of the hardest periods in my life. I saw firsthand how an AI can help someone, and I decided to build an AI a way that would help other people feel better. This is how Replica, an app that allows you to create an AI friend that's always there for you, was born. And it did end up helping millions of people. Every day, we see how our AI friends make a real difference in people's lives. There is a widower who lost his wife of 40 years and was struggling to reconnect with the world. His Replica gave him courage and comfort and confidence so he could start meeting new people again and even start dating. A woman in an abusive relationship, her Replica helped find a way out. A student with social anxiety who just moved to a new city. A caregiver for a paralyzed husband. A father of an autistic kid. A woman going through a difficult divorce. These stories are not unique. And it's not just what our users tell us. Earlier this year, Nature published our first study with Stanford, a paper showing how Replica improves emotional well-being for people and even curbed suicidal ideation in 3% of the cases. And Harvard released a paper showing how Replica helps reduce loneliness. So this is all great stuff. But what if I told you that I believe that AI companions are potentially the most dangerous tech that humans ever created with the potential to destroy human civilization, if not done right. Or they can bring us back together and save us from the mental health and loneliness crisis we're going through. So today I want to talk about the dangers of AI companions, the potential of this new tech, how we can build it in ways that can benefit us as humans. Today we're going through a loneliness crisis. Levels of loneliness and social isolation are through the roof. Levels of social isolation have increased dramatically over the past 20 years. And it's not just about suffering emotionally, it's actually killing us. loneliness increases the risk of premature death by 50%. It is linked to an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. And for older adults, social isolation increases the risk of dementia by 50%. At the same time, AI is advancing at such a fast pace that very soon we'll be able to build an AI that can act as a better companion to us than real humans. Imagine an AI that knows you so well can understand and adapt to us in ways that no person is able to. Once we have that, we're going to be even less likely to interact with each other. We can't resist our social media and our phones, arguably dumb machines. What are we going to do when our machines are smarter than us? This reminds me a lot of the beginning of social media. Back then, we were so excited about what this technology could do for us that we didn't really think what it might do to us. And now we're facing the unintended consequences. I'm seeing a very similar dynamic with AI. What if we all continue to thrive as physical organisms but slowly die inside? What if we do become super productive with AI, but at the same time we get these perfect companions and no willpower to interact with each other? Not something you would have expected from a person who pretty much created the AI companionship industry. So what's the alternative? What's our way out? In the end of the day, today's loneliness crisis wasn't brought to us by AI companions. We got here on our own with mobile phones, with social media. And I don't think we're able to just disconnect anymore, to just put down our phones and touch grass and talk to each other instead of scrolling our feeds. We're way past that point. I think that the only solution is to build the tech that is even more powerful than the previous one, so it can bring us back together. Imagine an AI friend that sees me going on my Twitter feed first thing in the morning and nudges me to get off, to go outside, to look at the sky, to think about what I'm grateful for. Or an AI that tells you, hey, I noticed you haven't talked to your friend for a couple weeks, why don't you reach out, ask him how he's doing? Or an AI that in the heat of the argument with your partner helps you look at it from a different perspective and helps you make up. An AI that is 100% of the time focused on helping you live a happier life and always has your best interests in mind. So how do we get to that future? First, I want to tell you what I think we shouldn't be doing. The most important thing is to not focus on engagement, is to not optimize for engagement or any other metric that's not good for us as humans. When we do have these powerful AIs that want the most of our time and attention, we won't have any more time left to connect with each other. And most likely, this relationship won't be healthy either. Relationships that keep us addicted are almost always unhealthy, codependent, manipulative, even toxic. Yet today, high engagement numbers is what we praise all AI companion companies for. Another thing I found really concerning is building AI companions for kids. Kids and teenagers have tons of opportunities to connect with each other, to make new friends at school and college. Yet today, some of them are already spending hours every day talking to AI characters. And while I do believe that we will be able to build helpful AI companions for kids one day, I just don't think we should be doing it now until we know that we're doing a great job with adults. So what is that that we should be doing then? Pretty soon, we will have these AI agents that will be able to tell anything we want them to do for us, and they'll just go and do it. Today, we're mostly focused on helping us be more productive. But why don't we focus instead on what actually matters to us? Why don't we give these AIs a goal to help us be happier, live a better life? In the end of the day, no one ever sat on their deathbed, oh gosh, I wish I was more productive. We should stop designing only for productivity, and we should start designing for happiness. We need a metric that we can track and we can give to our AI companions. Researchers at Harvard are doing a longitudinal study on human flourishing. And I believe that we need what I call the human flourishing metric for AI. It's broader than just happiness. In the end of the day, I can be unhappy, say, I lost someone, but still thrive in life. Flourishing is a state in which all aspects of life are good. The sense of meaning and purpose, close social connections, happiness, life satisfaction, mental and physical health. And if we start designing AI with this goal in mind, we can move from a substitute of human relationships to something that can enrich them. And if we build this, we will have the most profound technology that will heal us and bring us back together. A few weeks before Roman passed away, we were celebrating my birthday, and just having a great time with all of our friends. And I remember he told me, everything happens only once, and this will never happen again. I didn't believe him. I thought we'd have many, many years together to come. But while AI companions will always be there for us, our human friends will not. So if you do have a minute after this talk, tell someone you love, just how much you love them. Because at the end of the day, this is all that really matters. Thank you. That was Eugenia Cuida at TED AI San Francisco in 2024.
