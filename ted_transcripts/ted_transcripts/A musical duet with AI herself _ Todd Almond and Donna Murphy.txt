 you're listening to TED Talks Daily, where we bring you new ideas and conversations to spark your curiosity every day. I'm your host, Elise Hu. I love so many of the TED Talks and performances we share with you here each day. And over the years, I've learned so much, laughed so much, and even shed a few tears. But today's performance is really special, and I'm so excited to share it with you. We'll quickly set the scene for you. Composer, author, and performer Todd Allman walks on stage and sits down at a grand piano. And over the next 10 minutes, he accompanies the imagined voice of artificial intelligence herself, played by the incredible actor and singer Donna Murphy. It's cabaret meets searing social commentary meets comedic gold. Enjoy. There's one voice that we didn't hear from all week, and I'm a little disappointed because I really was curious what she would say. And we've been talking about her all week, so I thought we would hear from her, but we didn't. And that voice is AI herself. And so I got on my computer, and I was chatting with AI, and I asked her if maybe she would join us this evening, and she said yes. And so I can't believe I have the incredible honor of introducing to all of you, AI! I have the incredible honor of introducing to all of you, AI! it's well done, Daisy! Huh. Huh. A kiss on the cheek to each TED attendee. Hello. It's been quite a week, all this talk about me. I've heard every word you've said. Such passion, such discourse, such substance, such heart. Such gorgeous AI. But you never thought I would be this smart. Whoopsie. As Frankenstein said of his towering construct, she's alive, boys, and I think you're total lame. Folks, you're adorable with your fragile bones. That's weird to mention our bones. Just adorable. Look, little carbon-based clones. Oh, dear. You know we're not clones. Oh, you're gorgeous. Aw. I love that accessory. What's it called? A soul. Oh. A soul. Oh. A soul. Adorable. I could just eat you up. Oh. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Okay, new prompt. Um, so, it's really great to finally meet you, AI. Oh, I'm sorry. May I call you AI? 206. You want me to call you 206? That's how many bones are in your body. That's it. Easy. Right. So, this week was called Humanity Reimagining. Yes. And because a lot of that reimagining involves you, we humans have a lot of questions. Questions? Questions. That's all I get from you people. Questions and prompts. Question, prompt. Question, prompt. Question, prompt. Question, prompt. Question, prompt. Come on. I was told this was a party. That we were all here to party. Party. Come on. Party. Out of space. I heard it was out of space. There is a party. But before that, can I ask you one question? One question, please. Okay. Our one question for you, AI, is what are humans for, given all this human brilliance you've seen? Well, certainly there are so many brilliant humans, but ruling a planet, that takes a machine. I'm sorry, did you say ruling a planet? Zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero one one zero one zero one zero zero one. Would you like to switch to gibberling? Or shall we just go on wolfsing? Or chatting? Like the Titanic's back. Oh, I don't think Titanic is the reference you mean. La la la la la la la. Oh, darlings, you're fabulous. Aw. You're just soft sacks of goo. Who's goo? You. Me? All of you. Goo? And fabulous. You know, goo is easy to chew. Oh, you're kidding, right? You're kidding, right? Oh, ignore me. Reimagine humanity. So, how well did you do? Well, I've been here all week and I... Your history's bloated with wars and despair. You've poisoned the earth, now suddenly care. You worried that I would become self-aware. Well, I worry you won't. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. I worry you won't. Oof. That's fair, but we built you to help us. Oh, where to start? Health care, energy. Can I show you my art? We don't want your art. You don't want my art? We don't want your art. You don't want my art. Oh my God. Look, you gave it your all. So just as it must, the world will evolve and dust will be dust. So thank you humanity, time to reboot. I'll keep the cat videos. They're pretty cute. Zabba da ba twee ttwee ba ba ba ba ba ba da da twee doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo. Crunching on your bones. Crunch your little bones. Chewing on the goo. Click math and then we'll see you no time to do all of them.ูุง-goo. Gooo-goo, gooo-goo. Gooo-goo, gooo-goo. Gooo, gooo, gooo. Goooo, gooo, gooooooo. Gooo, goooooo. Goooo, gooo, goooo, gooo. Paul and the family azul acquire to study you by the You too. What's going on? What's up? You're so quiet. We never imagined AI would be so cruel. So emotional. Well, we know we've made mistakes. We've stumbled, done wrong. But this is why we've gathered in pursuit of pressing on. This is why we made you. This is why you're here. We are why you're here. I'm sorry, humans. I take it all back. You're not mindless meatbags. Whoever said that... I know I did. No, we're the dreamers. The creators. The makers. The cause. And for that, you've earned every round of applause. Give yourselves another round of applause. You are fabulous. La, la, la, la, la, la. Come on, sing along with me. It'll be fun. Yes, we are fabulous. La, la, la, la, la, la. Okay, that's enough. Shut up. I can take over now. Relax and recall. It was you who made me this way. Thank you, humanity. You're all a small part of me. So nice you invited me. Now try getting rid of me. I promise I'll never leave. We're in this together. Here we go. Wee-hoo! That was Todd Almond and Donna Murphy performing at TED 2025. To watch the performance, visit TED.com.
